# ðŸš— Vehicle Speed Estimation System using Deep Learning

This project uses deep learning and computer vision techniques to estimate the speed of vehicles in video footage. It combines YOLOv8 for object detection, ByteTrack for multi-object tracking, and OpenCV for frame-by-frame analysis to calculate real-time vehicle speeds.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Highlights
- **YOLOv8**: Detects vehicles with high accuracy and speed
- **ByteTrack**: Maintains consistent tracking across frames
- **OpenCV**: Calculates speed based on pixel displacement and frame rate
- **Overlay**: Annotates video frames with bounding boxes and speed labels

## ðŸ§° Tech Stack
- Python
- YOLOv8 (Ultralytics)
- ByteTrack
- OpenCV
- NumPy

# ðŸš€ How to Run
1. Clone the repository  
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`  
3. Run the script: `python speed_estimation.py`  
4. View the output in `output_video.mp4`
